# ECoL-Python

This code provides a Python interface for [The Extended Complexity Library](https://github.com/lpfgarcia/ECoL).
It can compute the specified data complexity measure for a provided data subset.
Implementation details and use examples are provided in the `python_ecol.py` file.

## Prerequisites

Install R and install the ECoL library in R:

```
install.packages("ECoL")
```


Install Python package dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Run the code

Run the `python_ecol.py` file which will compute complexities for given complexity measure and a data subset.

```
python python_ecol.py
```
